# gnbImp - Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation

**gnbImp** is a simple implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) in Python. This class is designed for educational purposes to understand the core principles behind GNB and its application in classification tasks.

## Overview

The **gnbImp** class provides a basic implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm for classification. It includes methods for fitting the model, predicting class probabilities, and making predictions.


## Dependencies

The implementation relies on the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `math`: Python's built-in library for mathematical functions.
- `operator`: Used for prediction within the implementation.

Ensure you have these libraries installed in your Python environment.
